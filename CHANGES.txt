Version 0.7 on 2016-11-16:
  * Added 'dot' function.
  * Added `flip option to 'mls' and 'mlsq' and `lflip`rflip options to 'mm'.
  * Added option to build OpenBLAS instead of Netlib BLAS, improving LAPACK
    performance (see ./configure --help).
  * Multiple optimizations in LAPACK interface code.
  * Fixed crash in 'mlsx' with `equi and incompatible matrix shapes (e.g.
     .qml.mlsx[`equi;1 1#.1;100 100#.1]).

Version 0.6 on 2015-12-27:
  * Support compiling on OS X.
  * Analytic gradient functions can be specified in 'min', 'conmin' and 'solve'.
  * Removed input of complex coefficients to 'poly' to reduce build time and
    binary size. Complex roots are still returned.
  * Fixed crash in 'conmin' with `cobyla and empty params (e.g.,
     .qml.conminx[`cobyla;{};();()]).

Version 0.5.5 on 2015-06-21:
  * Fixed 'mpinv' increasing numerical rank of matrix (e.g.,
    .qml.mrank[.qml.mpinv(1 2;3 6)]<>1).

Version 0.5.4 on 2015-03-11:
  * Fixed compiling on GCC 4.1.
  * Updated test suite generator to use SymPy and mpmath.

Version 0.5.3 on 2014-12-12:
  * Support compiling on MSYS.

Version 0.5.2 on 2014-06-16:
  * Fixed compiling on Cygwin with latest k.h.

Version 0.5.1 on 2014-05-14:
  * Fixed crash in square matrix functions when called with inappropriate type
    (e.g., .qml.mdet[`]).

Version 0.5 on 2013-12-31:
  * Linked to NLopt to provide more optimization algorithms, exposed as `nl and
    `sbplx options for 'min' and `cobyla option for 'conmin'.
  * Added 'mkron' function.

Version 0.4 on 2013-05-12:
  * Added support for kdb+ 3.0.
  * Added option to link with external BLAS and LAPACK libraries.
  * Removed support for building ATLAS. Reference BLAS and LAPACK can be built
    using the --build-blas and --build-lapack configure options.
  * Build with
      ./configure && make
  * Test with
      make test
  * Install with
      make install
    This copies qml.so to the q binary directory, because qml.q no longer
    searches for it in the current working directory.
  * Added 'mdim' function.

Version 0.3.10 on 2011-07-13:
  * Replaced ATLAS-specific calls with Fortran interface calls in preparation
    for allowing linking with external BLAS and LAPACK libraries.

Version 0.3.9 on 2011-07-11:
  * Updated to ATLAS 3.9.46.
  * Added 'make check' target to run tests for individual libraries (ATLAS).

Version 0.3.8 on 2011-07-08:
  * Fixed patching process on Darwin: some sed scripts were not portable.
  * Limited static linking of Fortran test programs to Cygwin, as it was
    failing on some other platforms.

Version 0.3.7 on 2011-07-04:
  * Fixed building of ATLAS on 64-bit Windows.
  * Prevented invalid read in CONMAX on NaN input.

Version 0.3.6 on 2011-06-30:
  * Fixed building of ATLAS on 64-bit Linux.

Version 0.3.5 on 2011-06-28:
  * Added 'mls'/'mlsx' and 'mlsq'/'mlsqx' functions.
  * A matrix of null values is now returned instead of an empty list in case of
    singular input to 'minv' and 'ms', non-positive-definite input to 'mchol',
    and computation failure in 'mev' and 'msvd'.

Version 0.3.4 on 2011-06-26:
  * The system libm is used instead of FDLIBM.
  * ATLAS is now the default and only option. CLAPACK is replaced with Fortran
    LAPACK. A Fortran compiler is required to build.
  * Two-argument scalar functions are now only threaded over a vector in the
    second argument, but not in the first, except 'atan2', 'pow', 'fmod',
    'hypot' and 'beta', which are threaded over both arguments. Three-argument
    functions are now threaded over a vector in the third argument.
  * Coefficients supplied to 'poly' must be either atoms or two-element vectors
    representing complex numbers. One-element vectors are not accepted.
  * Bytes (type "x") are no longer accepted for any numeric arguments.

Version 0.3.3 on 2011-06-13:
  * Added 'mm' and 'ms' functions.

Version 0.3.2 on 2011-06-04:
  * When compiling with ATLAS, use the provided optimized LAPACK routines and
    parameters.

Version 0.3.1 on 2011-06-01:
  * Removed support for alternative build profiles and for compiling using
    Windows SDK.
  * Added option to compile with ATLAS instead of reference BLAS, improving
    LAPACK performance.

Version 0.2.1 on 2010-02-17:
  * Added 'root'/'rootx', 'solve'/'solvex', 'line'/'linex', 'min'/'minx' and
   'conmin'/'conminx' nonlinear optimization functions.

Version 0.1.8 on 2009-10-25:
  * Old 'mdiag' function renamed to 'diag', which creates a diagonal matrix.
    New 'mdiag' function added to extract the main diagonal from a matrix.
    The intended convention is that "m" functions operate on matrixes.
  * Added 'mqrp' and 'mrank' matrix functions.
  * Added 'bncdf', 'bnicdf', 'pscdf', 'psicdf', 'smcdf', 'smicdf', 'kcdf' and
   'kicdf' probability functions.

Version 0.1.7 on 2009-10-13:
  * Support building with GCC 3 on Linux.
  * Support building on 64-bit OpenSolaris (x86).

Version 0.1.6 on 2009-10-12:
  * Fixed integer argument size in LAPACK calls on 64-bit Linux, OpenSolaris
    and Darwin.
  * Added 'mqr' and 'mlup' functions.

Version 0.1.5 on 2009-10-06:
  * Preliminary support for OpenSolaris.

Version 0.1.4 on 2009-10-05:
  * Fixed thread safety, which is required for 'peach'.

Version 0.1.3 on 2009-10-01:
  * When calling LAPACK, query and allocate optimal workspace.
  * Support Darwin.

Version 0.1.2 on 2009-09-25:
  * Support GCC on Windows.

Version 0.1.1 on 2009-09-10:
    First release.
